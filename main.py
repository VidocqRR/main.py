 The Lazy Song" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter Bruno Mars for his debut studio album Doo-Wops & Hooligans (2010). 
 It was serviced to contemporary hit radios in the United States on February 15, 2011 as the album's third single by Atlantic and Elektra. 
 Development of "The Lazy Song" began while Bruno Mars, Philip Lawrence and Ari Levine were hanging around the studio and didnâ€™t feel like working. 
 Mars wrote the song in collaboration with singer-songwriter K'naan and his production team The Smeezingtons, who also produced the track.
 Musically, "The Lazy Song" has been described as borrowing "heavily from roots reggae", while lyrically it is an anthem to laziness.
